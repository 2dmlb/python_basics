My basic Python exercises

This repository contains my basic Python exercises while learning the language. 
It includes the following topics:

- input() and print()
- int and float numbers
- Strings: len(), strip(), upper(), lower()
- random module (randrange, randint)
- if / else statements

Each file represents a small exercise with comments explaining what it does.
